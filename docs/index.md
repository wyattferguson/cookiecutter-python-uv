# 🐍 Pattern - Modern Python Cookiecutter Project

Pattern is a modern, opinionated, cookiecutter template for your next Python project. Included is modern tooling and dependencies with sensible rules and settings. Also included is all the boilerplate documentation, GitHub actions, and project extras you would need to create good foundation for your next python project.

## Setup New Project

> [!note]
> Make sure you have [uv installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods) before you start.

Create new project:

```bash
uvx cookiecutter gh:wyattferguson/pattern
```

Alternatively you can use [Cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/):

```bash
uvx cruft create gh:wyattferguson/pattern
```

Then just follow the prompts, pick the tools you want to install, and watch the magic happen.
